### Feeding the blob
1. Not midnight
2. Mix equal parts
   1. [200g] Starter
   2. [200g] Flour
   3. [200g] Water
3. Stir until mixed
4. Leave at room temp overnight
5. Leave for 1 Week then rinse and repeat

## Make the dough
> Stand Mixer - Yes
>
> No metal - the blob has a PH ~3.5 (> Acid Rain & < Pepsi / Coke)
> 
> Mixer Attachment - Use the Claw?
> 
> 200g Makes 2 Loafs

1. combine 800g flour & 460g water. **(Autolyse)**
   1. Gently Mix.
   2. Cover with damp cloth
   3. Let sit 30m
2. Seperate starter - Assume 1:1:1
   1. see Feed the blob
3. Add remaining starter (200g) (~3/4c) to the **Autolyse**
4. Mix 5 Min
5. Add 18g (1tbsp) Salt
   1. [Optional] 12g (3tsp) Sugar
   1. [Optional] 1-2 tbsp oil
6. Mix until smooth
   1. Must pass window lane test
      1. *You can streatch untll it is thing enough to see though and doesnt fall apart*

## Rest the dough
1. Cover with damp cloth
2. Wait 30m then lift and fold dough
3. Repeat for 3-6h (longer = better)
4. Form dough and refrigeate overnight
   1. Better crust üë©‚Äçüç≥üßë‚Äçüç≥

## Dont start a fire time
1. Preheat over to 475F 
   1. Dutch over inside
2. Bake covered for 15m
3. Uncover and keep bakeing for (4)20-25 min
4. Cool - 30 min min

## Batch 01A
### 03/30/2024

#### TLDR
Yeah needed some work üß±
shit was DENSE

Input Starter: **200g** - (Leaned more foul smelling, but mildly alcholic)
Output Loafs: **2** (01A-1; 01A-2) - Complete loss **F+**
Cook Temp: **475F**

**Cook Time:**
   - **01A-1**: 15 Covered; ~22 Uncovered
     - Notes: Small, shorter than dutch oven and dense
   - **01A-2**: 15 Covered; ~28 Uncovered
     - Notes: Small, shorter than dutch oven and dense, burnt on bottom

**Immedite stupidlearned:**
1. Accident bypass of step 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
   1. Lead to seeming overly dry
2. Mix of starter, flour, water at once
   1. Notes, seemed very hard to incorporate and was rigid 
3. Not mixed enough
4. Extremely Low relitive humidity

Outcome: Assuiming density if the flour combinded with mistake 3 lead to suppressed yeast activation

## Batch 02A
### 04/06/2024

#### TLDR
Damn shit was üî•

Input Starter: 200g - (Leaned more foul smelling, but mildly alcholic)
Output Loafs: 2 (02A-1; 02A-2) - Both viable **B+**
Cook Temp: 475F

**Notes:**
   - Omitted sugar
   - Supress yeast and lean more sour

**Mixing:**
   - Metod: by hand 100%
   - Beating time: 1h
   - Method: Stretch press and pull ?

**Cook Time:**
   - **02A-1**: 15 Covered; ~25 Uncovered
     - Notes: Larger than the dutch over and easy to lift
   - **02A-1**: 15 Covered; ~25 Uncovered
     - Notes: Smaller of the 2 - Larger than the dutch over and easy to lift

**Immedite stupidlearned:**
1. Added more water and beat by hand
   1. Fixed over dryness
2. Enforced ambient temp of 78F and kept clots very damp, but not dripping
3. Dough was fay lighter and rose naturally
5. Window lane per google is hard to judge
   1. My method
      1. Can it reexpandc wen pressed out frpm the centnert
      2. it can hold its own weight when lifted in the air for 5-10s

1. Improvements:
   - Increase "sour"

## Batch 03A
### 04/13/2024

#### TLDR
Damn shit was üî•üìà

Input Starter: 200g - (almost no foul smell, more alcholic almost like a wine)
Output Loafs: 2 (03A-1; 03A-2) - Both viable, trending in the right direction **A-** 
Cook Temp: 475F

Timeline:
   - 4/12/24 16:00 - put starter on warm oven (<=83F)
   - 4/12/24 22:00 - once starter had expaned then dropped split and fed 200g 1:1:1 - left lid adjar (~78-74F)
   - 4/13/24 11:00 - Made Autolyse
   - 4/14/24 11:30 - Made dough
   - 4/14/24 12:10 - Finished beating dough (by hand) (~40 min)
   - 4/14/24 18:00 - Let rise and fold (every 30m) (6 hours)

   - 4/15/24 11:46 - Started 03A-1 covered 15 min (475F Dutch Oven) (cut in deep X pattern - Deeper seems almost better)
   - 4/15/24 11:59 - Started 03A-1 Uncovered 20 min - Cut deep open crust lightly tan, center bubbly and white - almost taller than the dutchoven (slightly lower than 02A-1)
   - 4/15/24 12:20 - Checked 03A-1 light golden brown crust, very edges leaning darkbrown, inside looks doughy but not bad (leaving for 3 min)
   - 4/15/24 12:24 - Removed 03A-1 (dutch oven stays) - deeping golden brown crust, very edges leaning darkbrown, inside looks firm light golden 

   - 4/15/24 12:28 - Started 03A-2 covered 15 min (475F Dutch Oven) (cut in deep X pattern - Deeper seems almost better)
   - 4/15/24 12:45 - Started 03A-2 Uncovered 20 min - Cut deep open crust lightly tan, center bubbly and white - almost taller than the dutchoven seemed more lateraly spreadout vs 03A-1
   - 4/15/24 13:05 - Checked 03A-2 light golden brown crust, very edges leaning darkbrown, inside looks doughy but not bad (leaving for 3 min)
   - 4/15/24 13:08 - Removed 03A-2 Deeping golden brown crust, very edges leaning darkbrown, inside looks firm light golden 

   - 4/15/24 13:00 - Cut Open 03A-1 30 min rest - Solid progress, maybe slightly denser than 02A but more sour and by no means bad
   - 4/15/24 13:40 - Bagged 03A-2 30 min rest - slightly smaller - Assuming will be near idet to 03A-1 - Visually much more carmel and smooth in the center seems like amore even toast

Cook Time:
   - **03A-1**: 15 Covered; ~23 Uncovered
     - Notes: samller and seems moderatly dense
   - **03A-2**: 15 Covered; ~25 Uncovered
     - Notes: Smaller of the 2 - Larger than the dutch over and easy to lift

1. Added more water and beat by hand
   1. Fixed over dryness

3. Dough was fay lighter and rose naturally
5. Window lane per google is hard to judge
   1. My method
      1. Can it re-expaned wen pressed out frpm the centnert
      2. it can hold its own weight when lifted in the air for 5-10s

**Delta from 02A:**
   - Less beating time, more water while beating (~2 tbsp oil)
   - Covered in damp towel in fridge (vs paper towel)
   - Let 03A sit on top oven at 200F so was ~85F & 49% RH, kept cloth damp, added no water, but added flour (possibly too much accidently)
      - 03A visabilily rose way more during the rest stage vs 02A

**Improvements:**
   - Increase "sour" more
   - Find density sweetspot
